# The Linux Game

This game is a lot of mini games that you can play in the terminal.
It is written in Bash and it is a fun way to learn some basic commands and advanced commands if you see the Game.sh file.

## Commands in game
- ls 
- cd 
- touch
- mv
- chmod
- rm

## Commands to add 
- tar 
- zip
- chown
- su 
- sudo 
- curl 
- grep 
- pipelining (it's not a command but it's nice)
- mkdir
- echo
- export
- pwd
- diff
- git

## Issues 
- missing tests for commands 
- the story for each command to make it more fun to user
- how to use for each command that will add to the cheat sheet
